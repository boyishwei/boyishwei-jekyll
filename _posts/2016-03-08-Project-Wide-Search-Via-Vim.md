Traditionally, in Linux or Unix, if we want to find a file or a string in a folder or a project, we use grep. As we use vim as the IDE like eclipse, or Intelj, can we search without leaving vim. The answer is yes, using the build-in search functionality within vim is much faster and elegant than a grep or some other dedicate unix tool. I will walk you through this.
