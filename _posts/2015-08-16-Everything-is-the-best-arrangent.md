My first post after transfrom my blog from ROR to Jekyll, it's really awsome.
It's easy to manage, update, post, publish.

Here is a list of what I used to simple setup my blog:
Nginx, as the server, which also carring some other website.
Gighub, as the blog repository.
Mina, deploy & publish new posts.
Jekyll, the main framework which my blog is based on.

From now on, I don't need to create post base on the old blog system build by my self, I don't need to edit post online,
Everything is done offline, just write a post within Jekyll and hit 'mina deploy', then all my post will be online.

Awsome.
